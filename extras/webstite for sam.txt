Tabbed interface shouldn't take up too much space

!! I forgot preferences

What will the client box do?
will this aggregate inbox & files specific to a client?

Should a different tab be the hometab? maybe inbox?

Should Sam OBrian have his own separate site or should it just be an employee one with more privilages/options?
